### jsonpiler 0.5

#### 0.5.3 ~ 0.5.4

- Fixed a critical bug in 0.5.0

#### 0.5.1 ~ 0.5.2

- Added `.bin binary` in .gitattributes

#### 0.5.0

- Fixed issue where some `mov` instructions with values â‰¥ 32-bit caused assembler errors.
- **Implemented assembler and linker inside `jsonpiler`; GNU `as` and `ld` no longer required.**
- Temporarily generated and deleted .s and .obj files are no longer generated.
- Temporarily disabled SEH.

### jsonpiler 0.4

#### 0.4.2

- Added a new function `concat` to concatenate string literals while preserving their literal nature.
- Split `Object` into three variants:
  - **HashMap**: a collection of key/value pairs.
  - ~~Sequence~~**Block**: an ordered sequence of instructions.
  - **TypeAnnotations**: type annotations for variables or functions.
- Now generates an error if a quadratic function is called without arguments.
- Implemented support for `lambda` arguments.
- Enhanced the types of `lambda` return values for richer type information.
- The minimum length of arguments for `+`, `/`, `*`, `or`, `and`, and `xor` is now 2.
- The return value of `message` is now `Null`.

#### 0.4.1

- Limiting input files to 1 GB or less eliminates unnecessary safety checks in the parser and speeds up the process.
- Changed the way assembly instructions are stored, improving processing speed and memory efficiency.
- Eliminated dependence on c functions (malloc, free), making `ucrtbase.dll` unnecessary.
- Split the documentation of built-in functions into several files because they became bloated.
- The timing of releasing a temporary value passed as an argument of a function not bound to a variable is now fixed at the end of the function. (Exception: the last temporary value of the body of `if` is released.)
- The argument format of `if`, `scope`, and `lambda` has been changed.
- A new function `value` has been added. This function is used to add a literal to the end of an Object's instruction sequence.

#### 0.4.0

- Added new function: `not`, `xor`, `or`, and `and`.
- The built-in functions have become bloated and have been split into multiple files.
- Changed bool type memory area from 1bit to 1byte due to expected large performance degradation due to instruction bloat
- Intuitive function argument validation.

### jsonpiler 0.3

#### 0.3.5

- Added new function: `if`
- Fixed an issue in version 0.1.6 where docs.rs documents were sometimes not generated, and removed alternative documents that were no longer needed.
- Change space characters around instructions in the generated assembly to tab characters.
- Removed documentation comments with little content.
- Added Japanese version to changelog and README.md.

#### 0.3.4

- Support for `bool` type assignments.
- Refactor the code to generate assembly instructions and labels in a more maintainable and systematic way.

#### 0.3.3

- Fixed a bug where memory was not correctly released from the stack when handling scope-based logic.
- Fixed a situation where the `scope` function ignored the first argument.
- Removed redundant safety checks

#### 0.3.2

- `Float` can now be assigned.
- Function definitions now explicitly share only the global scope.
- Fixed a bug in the `global` function.

#### 0.3.1

- Added new functions: `/`, `abs`, and `%`.

#### 0.3.0

- Json objects now allow duplicate keys.
- **Objects are now treated as function calls**:  
  Each key in a JSON object is interpreted as a function name, and its corresponding value is treated as the function argument.
- It is no longer allowed to assign a user-defined function to a variable name that already exists as a built-in function.
- **Arrays now leave the result of evaluating all elements.**:  
- **Supports multiple key-function entries.**:  
  When an object contains multiple keys, each is evaluated in order; the last function result is returned.
- Square brackets can now be omitted when a single argument is not an array.
- The `begin` function was removed because it can now be represented by a column of objects.

### jsonpiler 0.2

#### 0.2.3

- Refactored and cleaned up source code.
- ~~Duplicate object keys are no longer allowed.~~
- Added temporary value tracking to enable efficient stack freeing, minimizing stack waste except for variable bindings.
- Improved error formatting to display ^ markers spanning the full error range using `pos.size`.

#### 0.2.2

- Added `examples` directory.
- Built-in functions now have priority over user-defined functions.
- To give priority to user-defined functions, write them as `["$", "function"]`.
- Added the ability to efficiently store free space on the stack and fill that space as needed.
- Unary `-` now correctly negates a single argument.

#### 0.2.1

- Local variables are now stored on the stack.
- Fixed a problem that caused the assembler to fail if `+`, `-`, or `*` takes more than 32-bit literals as operands.
- Added the ability to allocate stacks at the start of a scope and release them at the end.

#### 0.2.0

- `begin` no longer introduces a scope; instead, the new `scope` function handles scoping.
- Added new functions: `scope`, `*`, `list`, and `'`.

### jsonpiler 0.1
