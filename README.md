# Jsonpiler - JSON Syntax Programming Language

**Jsonpiler** is a compiler for the JSON syntax programming language and its compiler.

This program converts a JSON-based program to GNU assembly, compiles it, and executes the result.

## What's New

- **Added new function: `not`, `xor`, `or`, and `and`.**
- **The built-in functions have become bloated and have been split into multiple files.**
- **Changed bool type memory area from 1bit to 1byte due to expected large performance degradation due to instruction bloat**
- **Intuitive function argument validation**.
- Added new function: `if`
- Fixed an issue in version 0.1.6 where docs.rs documents were sometimes not generated, and removed alternative documents that were no longer needed.
- Change space characters around instructions in the generated assembly to tab characters.
- Removed documentation comments with little content.
- Added Japanese version to changelog and README.md.

## Prerequisites

**Make sure the following tools are installed and available in your PATH environment variable:**

- `ld` (from MinGW-w64)  
- `as` (from MinGW-w64)  

**The following DLLs must be present in `C:\Windows\System32\` for the program to work correctly:**

- `kernel32.dll`  
- `user32.dll`  
- `ucrtbase.dll`  

## Installation & Usage

```bash
cargo install jsonpiler
jsonpiler (input_json_file (UTF-8)) [arguments of .exe ...]
```

Replace `(input_json_file)` with the actual JSON file you want to compile.

## Example

[Examples](https://github.com/HAL-G1THuB/jsonpiler/blob/main/examples)

```json
{ "=": ["a", "title"], "message": [{"$": "a"}, "345"] }
```

**Execution order:**

The jsonpiler code consists of a single JSON object.

Expressions are evaluated sequentially.

The variable `"a"` is assigned the string `"title"` using `"="`.

A message box appears with the title (from the variable `"a"`) and the body `"345"` as specified by `"message"`.

The program returns the integer ID of the button pressed in the message box (currently only `1` is supported, which corresponds to `IDOK` in C/C++), as the final value of the `{}` block.

## Error or warning message format

```json
{ "message": ["title", { "$": "doesn't_exist" }] }
```

```text
Compilation error: Undefined variables: `doesn't_exist`
Error occurred on line: 1
Error position:
{ "message": ["title", { "$": "doesn't_exist" }] }
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
