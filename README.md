# Jsonpiler â€” JSON Syntax Programming Language

**Jsonpiler** is a compiler and runtime for a programming language that uses **JSON** or **JSPL (Jsonpiler Structured Programming Language)** as its syntax.  It converts a JSON-based program into **x86\_64 Windows PE** machine code, links it, and executes the result.
Jsonpiler bundles an assembler and linker purpose-built for its IR and PE output on Windows.

## Whatâ€™s New

### 0.6.4

- Fixed a problem in which the fifth and later arguments of user-defined functions were not recognized correctly.
- Four arithmetic operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` now support Float type
- Added function to truncate Float to integer: `Int`.
- Added I/O function: `print`.
- Fixed an error in `global` function.

See **[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/HAL-G1THuB/jsonpiler/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)** for full history and plans.

## Requirements

No external toolchains or libraries are required.

**The following system DLLs must be available in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`:**

- `kernel32.dll`
- `user32.dll`

These are present on standard Windows installations.

---

## Install & Run

```bash
cargo install jsonpiler

# Compile and execute a JSON program
jsonpiler <input.json> [args passed to the produced .exe]
```

- `<input.json>` must be UTF-8 encoded.
- Any additional arguments are forwarded to the generated executable at runtime.

## JSPL

With the introduction of JSPL (Jsonpiler Structured Programming Language),
Jsonpiler significantly improves human readability and writability,
which were challenging under the strict JSON-based syntax.
JSPL is designed to express function definitions,conditionals,
function calls, and variable assignments in a natural and intuitive form.
All JSPL code is internally transformed into the same JSON-based intermediate representation (IR),
ensuring full compatibility with the existing Jsonpiler compilation infrastructure
while making programs easier to write and understand.
For more details, see the language specification above.

| Differences from JSON         | JSON                                  | JSPL                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Curly braces `{}`**         | Required                              | Optional for top-level blocks                 |
| **Function call syntax**      | Explicit form like `{"sum": [1,2,3]}` | Natural syntax like `sum(1, 2, 3)`            |
| **Identifier notation**       | All keys must be quoted `"string"`    | Unquoted identifiers are allowed              |
| **Ternary-style syntax**      | Not supported                         | `1 + 10` â†’ expanded to `{ "+": [1, 10] }`     |
| **Variable reference syntax** | Explicit form like `{"$": "name"}`    | Can be written as `$name`                     |
| **Comments**                  | Not allowed (by spec)                 | Supported via `# comment`                     |
| **Control structures**        | Written as functions                  | Syntactic sugar like `if(...)`, `define(...)` |

## Examples

Browse ready-to-run samples in **`examples/`**:
[https://github.com/HAL-G1THuB/jsonpiler/blob/main/examples](https://github.com/HAL-G1THuB/jsonpiler/blob/main/examples)

Minimal example:

```json
{ "=": ["a", "title"], "message": [{"$": "a"}, "345"], "+": [1, 2, 3] }
```

### Execution order

- A Jsonpiler program is a single JSON object whose keys are evaluated **sequentially**.
- `"="` assigns the string `"title"` to the variable `a`.
- `"message"` prints the value of `a` followed by `"345"`.
- `"+"` computes the sum of `1`, `2`, and `3`, i.e., **6**.

The programâ€™s **final expression value** becomes the process **exit code**. Running under `cargo run` may look like this (Windows reports process exit code 6):

```text
error: process didn't exit successfully: `jsonpiler.exe test.json` (exit code: 6)
```

This is expected behavior and not an error in Jsonpiler itself.

## Diagnostics (Errors & Warnings)

**Input:**

```json
{ "message": ["title", { "$": "doesn't_exist" }] }
```

**Output:**

```text
Compilation error: Undefined variables: `doesn't_exist`
Error occurred on line: 1
Error position:
{ "message": ["title", { "$": "doesn't_exist" }] }
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

## Notes

- Output is a native **PE executable** for Windows x64.
- SEH is currently disabled and may be re-enabled in a future release.
- If you see a non-zero exit code under Cargo, it likely reflects your programâ€™s final value.
